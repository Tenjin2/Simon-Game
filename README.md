<h1>🎮 Simon Game</h1>
A web-based memory game inspired by the classic Simon game. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — perfect for practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.

<h3>🧠 How to Play</h3>
The game starts when the user presses a key.

A color pattern is generated by the system, and the player must replicate the pattern.

With every correct sequence, the game adds a new color to the pattern.

If the user clicks the wrong color, the game is over and resets.

Responsive design

Sound effects for clicks and wrong input
